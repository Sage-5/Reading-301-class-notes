Domain controllers are an integral part of running any network. A network will need to be centralized with a domain controller so authorization and permissions 
can be set. It does creat a single point of failure in the sense that if it is compromised than the whole network goes down. Which is why DNS attacks are so 
prevalant and effective. Within the expansion of technology and services they are becoming more sophisticated. All the reason to shore up to prevent an attack 
from happening. The attacks can affect a business reputation as well as finances, and valuable data can be stolen. In order to mitigate these attacks users will
need to be educated on how easy they can occur. Even if someone just mistypes a domain name an attacker could have it set up to look like the real deal. I dont
see an end to these attacks but think user education will help to prevent them.
